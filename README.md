## Documentation

The Agent runs inside your VPC and acts as a reverse proxy to connect with your metric sources and send
metrics and related data to doctor droid cloud platform. The agent is designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy
with only egress tcp calls to Doctor Droid Cloud Platform.

Currently, the agent supports the following metric sources in your VPC:

* Grafana
* Grafana Loki
* Cloudwatch
* Azure AKS (via native Kubernetes)
* AWS EKS (via AWS/native Kubernetes)
* GKE (via native Kubernetes)
* Kubernetes
* New Relic
* Datadog
* Opensearch
* MongoDB
* Github
* Postgres
* Any SQL Database (via Sql Connection String)
* Bash Commands

Releasing soon (reach out to us if you need support for these or any other source):
* Azure

## Installation
To get started create an agent authentication token by visiting [site](https://playbooks.drdroid.io/agent-tokens)

### Docker Compose
1. Create credentials/secret.yaml file with integration credentials. Secret format for different connections can be referenced from [credentials/credentials_template.yaml.](https://github.com/DrDroidLab/drd-vpc-agent/blob/main/credentials/credentials_template.yaml)

Command:
```shell
./deploy_docker.sh <API_TOKEN>
```
For any update the agent, re-run the command.


### Helm
1. Add the secrets for the integrations in helm/configmap.yaml file.
   Refer to the image below for a sample:

Command:
```shell
cd helm
./deploy_helm.sh <API_TOKEN>
```

* The agent will be installed in the namespace 'drdroid' by default. This can be changed in the helm/deploy_helm.sh file.
* Agent updates the image automatically every day at 00:00 UTC.
* Agent will have read access to the cluster and will be able to fetch the metrics from the cluster.
